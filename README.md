# Tower-Of-Hanoi
Tower Of Hanoi Problem is solved in java using the recursion.

The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic problem that can be solved easily usingrecursion, but it is difficult to solve otherwise.

The problem involves moving a specified number of disks of distinct sizes from one tower to another while observing the following rules:

 ■ There are n disks labeled 1, 2, 3, . . . , n and three towers labeled A, B, and C.
 ■ No disk can be on top of a smaller disk at any time.
 ■ All the disks are initially placed on tower A.
 ■ Only one disk can be moved at a time, and it must be the smallest disk on a tower.
 
The objective of the problem is to move all the disks from A to B with the assistance of C. For example, if you have three disks, the steps to move all of the disks from A to B are shown in the figure
